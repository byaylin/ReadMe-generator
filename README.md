# ReadMe-generator 

## Description
The task for this assignment was to create a ReadMe generator by having prompts for users to answer, resulting in a complete ReadMe generator. Rather than having to make ReadMe each time, this generator asks you a series of questions and makes a ReadMe for you. 

## Installation
Required to install npm inquirer version 8.2.4

## Usage 
To use, acess the integrated terminal in the index.js file. Once it is open, install the npm inquirer package. Type 'node index.js' in the command line, then a series of questions will be displayed. To move onto the next question, push the enter key. When all questions are completed, a ReadMe.MD file will be generated.
